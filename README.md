#**My first HTML/CSS login form based on facebook GUI**

##**About this small project**

This is a simple static web/login form baesd on facebook login UI.

##**Motivation**

At the time that I created this layout I was doing the 11th grade in technitian of information tecnhology, it was in 2015. I always wanted to learn web development in general, at that time I was beginning to learn web development by myself and I was studing  about HTML forms and after finish the theory and the small practices I decided to create something that would allow me to implement everything I learned so I decided to create a login form based on the facebook layout and at the time **create a social network was one of my biggest dream** :joy:, I decide to maintain this small project for alot of reasons but philosophically I can say that I decided to mantain it so I may remember where I came from in the web/front-end development world and also to share (my shit code, Joking I was just starting :smile:) with those who are just starting and with the community in general.
